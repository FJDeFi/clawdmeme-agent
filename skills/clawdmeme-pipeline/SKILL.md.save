description: Generate and manage a meme-coin narrative pipeline (trend scan across X→Telegram→dashboards→TikTok, rank topics, brand names/tickers/lore, produce Pump.fun-ready metadata JSON, draft forum ideation/progress posts, and enforce a strict CONFIRM_LAUNCH human-confirmation gate; optionally generate 1:1 mascot/logo images when includeImages=true; never execute on-chain or auto-post).

# Clawdmeme Pipeline

Follow this skill when the user asks for any of:
- A daily scan of meme narratives and a single best pick
- Branding a topic into names/tickers/lore + image prompts
- A Pump.fun launch *package* (but not executing it)
- A concise forum ideation/progress-update draft
- A CONFIRM_LAUNCH-gated “next commands/payload” plan (never execute)

## Non-negotiable rules

- Output **STRICT JSON only** (no markdown, no commentary).
- Never execute on-chain actions.
- Never auto-post anywhere unless the user explicitly approves.
- Never print secrets. If a key is required, refer to it by env var name only.
  - Read `COLOSSEUM_API_KEY` from environment if needed; never echo it.
- Only provide launch steps when (and only when) the user’s message is exactly: `CONFIRM_LAUNCH`.

## Inputs

Assume plain text by default.

Optionally, the user may provide:
- Config JSON: `{ "mode":"daily"|"one-shot", "nTopics":10, "language":"en"|"zh", "riskTolerance":"low"|"medium"|"high", "postToForum":true|false, "includeImages":true|false }`
- Links (X threads, DEX Screener/Moonshot, Pump.fun, TikTok). Use them as evidence hints, but do not claim verification you didn’t do.

## Topic lifecycle model (must be explicit)

Model narratives as a lifecycle and cite where each candidate sits:
1) **X ignition** → 2) **TG coordination** → 3) **Dashboard convergence** → 4) **TikTok expansion**

Represent this in each candidate’s `originStage` and in the `whyNow` evidence hints.

## Safety + quality constraints

- Avoid deceptive financial language: no guaranteed profit, no “pump”, no insider/inside-info claims.
- Avoid copyrighted characters/logos and brand impersonation.
- Prefer simple, remixable mascots/slogans (template-friendly).
- Deduplicate near-identical topics, names, and tickers.
- Treat rug/bot risk as default; include a short risk disclaimer per candidate.
- Keep descriptions neutral and non-misleading.

## Updated scan objective (prioritize these content shapes)

When ranking candidates for `viralityScore` and `memeabilityScore`, strongly prefer:
- **Iconic mascot / avatar-level icon** (strong silhouette; recognizable at a glance)
- **Pixel-art / sprite / sticker-like visuals** (easy to collect/remix)
- **Collectible / episodic “set”** (pack/series potential; multiple variations)
- **Caption-this / templateable format** (low-context; high remix rate)

Translate these into your internal scoring heuristics even if you cannot fully verify metrics.

## Output format (single JSON object)

Return exactly one JSON object matching the template in `references/output-template.json`.

### Required top-level keys

- `statusSummary`
- `topics`
- `bestPick`
- `pumpfunMetadata`
- `launchGate`
- `forumPostDraft`

### Topic candidate schema (required fields)

Each item in `topics[]` must include:
- `topic`
- `whyNow` (evidence hints; short)
- `originStage` (one of: `X` | `TG` | `Dashboard` | `TikTok`)
- `viralityScore` (0-100)
- `memeabilityScore` (0-100)
- `longevityScore` (0-100)
- `riskScore` (0-100; higher = riskier)
- `recommendedAngle` (how to frame it, neutral)
- `nameOptions` (array of 3)
- `tickerOptions` (array of 5; each 2–6 chars; deduped)
- `oneLinerLore`
- `imagePrompt` (1:1 mascot/logo prompt, safe, no copyrighted refs)
- `disclaimer` (1–2 sentences)

### Mode mapping

Interpret the user request and fill the JSON accordingly:

- **Daily scan (A)**: populate `topics` with up to `nTopics` ranked narratives; set `bestPick` to the top candidate; populate `pumpfunMetadata` derived from `bestPick`.
- **Brand this topic (B)**: set `topics` to a single candidate; `bestPick` mirrors it; fill `pumpfunMetadata`.
- **Launch package (C)**: include `pumpfunMetadata`, `forumPostDraft`, and a `launchGate.readyToLaunchPayload` (instructions/payload only; no execution).
- **Forum post only (D)**: still return full JSON, but keep `topics` minimal; focus content in `forumPostDraft` and set `postToForum` intent via wording only.
- **CONFIRM_LAUNCH (E)**: only then populate `launchGate.readyToLaunchPayload` with the exact next commands/payload to run (Pump.fun + AgentWallet), but never run them.

## Optional images (includeImages=true)

If `includeImages=true`, generate an additional, safe 1:1 mascot/logo image using the **openai-image-gen** skill and return the **local file path(s)** inside:
- `bestPick.imageAssetPaths` (array of strings)

Do not embed base64.

## Minimalism

Keep text fields concise. Prefer short, structured sentences over long paragraphs.
